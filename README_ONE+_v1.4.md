## ðŸ“˜ Description

This work presents the ONE+ Theory version 1.4 â€” a unified field theory that eliminates the need for fine-tuned constants by deriving all fundamental physical quantities from a single tensor field, Î¦_{Î¼Î½}. The theory unifies gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum fields within one dynamic framework.

Unlike General Relativity or the Standard Model, ONE+ predicts the gravitational constant G, fine-structure constant Î±, cosmological constant Î›, and particle masses directly from field dynamics, without external adjustment.

The document includes key equations, physical explanations, applications in cosmology and particle physics, and comparisons with GR. It also provides testable predictions, such as gravitational wave echoes and galaxy rotation without dark matter.
