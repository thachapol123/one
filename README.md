## ðŸ“˜ Description

This repository presents the ONE+ Theory version 1.4 â€” a unified field theory that eliminates the need for fine-tuned constants by deriving all fundamental physical quantities from a single tensor field, `Î¦_{Î¼Î½}`. The theory unifies gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum fields in a single dynamic framework.

Unlike General Relativity or the Standard Model, ONE+ predicts the gravitational constant `G`, fine-structure constant `Î±`, cosmological constant `Î›`, and particle masses directly from field dynamics, without external adjustment.

This repository includes documentation, metadata, and (optionally) simulation code related to the theory. The formulation is testable, consistent with experimental data, and mathematically complete.
